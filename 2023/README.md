Fam, I'm sorry for this atrocity of directories nested seemingly for no reason. Unfortunately due to the limitations of
stack/cabal project naming, there is no way to name my project just `2023`:

> A package is identified by a globally-unique package name, which consists of one or more alphanumeric words separated by hyphens. To avoid ambiguity, each of these words should contain at least one letter.

(From [Stack guide](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/))

As a consolation, I've created this README, so that the tree structure doesn't just show the `aoc2023` inside `2023`,
but instead `2023` now pretends to be an actual project. The least I could do to everyone supporting me in these harsh
times.

Yours truly
